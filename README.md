# Way Back Web
**ART 151 : Intro to Creative Coding**

**Project 1**

This is a website created using HTML, CSS, and p5.js to create an interactive website which mimicks the design and feel of websites from the late 90s and early 2000s.

Notable Features and Choices:
1. An interactable page created almost solely with JavaScript
2. Embeds and hotlinking rather than static storage, to emulate the processes of novice web developers of the time period.
3. Website elements archived directly from their respective time periods.

This project was extremely fun and taught me how a website works as both a server and a client in a unique way. It also introduced me to the therapeutic nature of website design and the beauty of internet art history!
