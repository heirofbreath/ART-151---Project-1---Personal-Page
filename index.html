                    <p>Hello! I am a fellow netizen of the web!!! You may call me <b>milk</b>.
                    <br>I am a freshman at UIC, and this is a project for my ART 151 (Intro to Creative Coding) class.
                    <br>In the process of developing this page, I have cycled through many ideas.
                    <br>Originally, I wanted to tell the story of someone's life through a website.
                    <br>As I redesigned website after website, I felt like something was missing.
                    <br>That was until I realized what drew me to the initial idea:
                    <br><span>How looking at someone's webpage felt similar to looking at the decoration in someone's room.</span>
                    <br>As someone who likely has ADD and is extremely unfocused yet concentrated at the same time, I am fascinated by the parodoxically cramped and free design of GeoCities era websites.
                    <br>So this me giving you the key, not to my room, but who I am online.
                    <br>Enjoy!</p>
